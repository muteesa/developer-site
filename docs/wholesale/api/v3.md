## Overview

### What is it?

The Simwood Customer API ("Application Programming Interface") is a way for your own back-office systems
and web sites to seamlessly integrate with Simwood and manage your wholesale telephony account and
services.

### What can I do with it?

The API is the preferred way to configure your Simwood services. Everything in the portal can also be
configured via the API (and in some cases the API offers some additional functionality)
Our portal is based on the API, and everything you can do in the portal you can do through the API in your own
code. We've deliberately made it this way. The only exception to this is the authentication elements of the
portal, as using your API key to log in on the web would be cumbersome.



### Databases
As before, many queries are made against MySQL although we have dedicated servers for the API's use.
These are built for queries and are slaves of masters. We can build additional query servers sideways as
required. Writes are, of course, made against the masters. Increasingly, API requests are served directly from
our underlying REDIS ram-based data stores where possible.
### Middle-ware
This API introduces multiple layers in between the above for performance and scale:
#### Beanstalkd Queues
We use Beanstalkd a lot for internal messaging. In this API where a request is non-trivial and involves
other processes, we'll simply queue a job.
#### REDIS
REDIS replaced memcached as our caching data store, and is used for much more as it supports a
number of advanced data structures facilitating vastly improved monitoring and real-time
information.
See http://blog.simwood.com/2013/06/real-time-big-data/ for more information.
#### App Servers
We have numerous daemons running monitoring specific queues (pipes in beanstalkd language). One
of the beautiful features of beanstalkd is that it is blocking, i.e. 10 daemons can watch the same pipe
and code will block waiting for a response.
One, and one only, will be given the job when there is one. This avoids polling – meaning this is
extremely efficient and very scalable as we can just spin up as many daemons as required. Further,
release of a job to a daemon is sub-millisecond giving the queueing the performance of direct
requests. Most complicated jobs involve multiple daemons working through a sequence of queues.

## Basic Operations
The Simwood API can be found at the following URI:
https://api.simwood.com/v3/

Please note that TLS v1.1 or Higher is Mandatory for all requests.

### Basic GET Requests

A number of end-points in the API can be accessed with a simple GET request and will therefore work in a
browser. Some do not require authentication and are a good place to start and to test connectivity to the API.

Two simple examples are:

https://api.simwood.com/v3/tools/myip - will return your IP address as seen by the API
https://api.simwood.com/v3/tools/time - will return a timestamp from the API

### JSON Output Format
You'll see that in both above cases the output is JSON, e.g:


```json
{
  "timestamp": 1388748052,
  "rfc": "Fri, 03 Jan 2014 11:20:52 +0000"
}
```

JSON ("JavaScript Object Notation") is used as it's a lightweight format designed for exchange of data
structures which has an additional advantage of being relatively human readable. All modern languages such
as PHP, ASP, .net, Node, Perl etc can handle JSON structures and convert to/from their native objects or
arrays easily making it the ideal choice for REST APIs.
### "Pretty" JSON
JSON is designed to be machine-readable and as such is sent with minimal whitespace by default however
when developing it is often useful to see the output in a more human-friendly format, you can achieve this
simply by appending `"?pretty=true"` to any endpoint e.g https://api.simwood.com/v3/tools/time?pretty=true
would look like this:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1388748052,
  "rfc": "Fri 03 Jan 2014 11:20:52 +0000"
}
```

### Authenticating Requests
Most commands are linked to an account and therefore require authentication.
We use standard Basic Authentication, i.e. your client makes a request, we respond with a 401 response code,
your client replies with the API username and password included.
Your API username and password were provided at the time of creating your Simwood account, if you do not
have these please contact our support team and we'll be happy to provide you with them.

Note that, at present:

- Your API username and password is not the same as your portal login details
- Your API password is designed to be used programatically, and is typically not memorable
- Your API details allow full access to your account, and must be protected accordingly.
- You cannot, currently, change your API username or password - although our support team are happy to
do so if required (e.g. if your details are lost or you have reason to believe they are compromised)

If you pull up an example URL in your browser it'll do this for you. For your code, different development
languages will tackle this in different ways but most will ‘just deal with it' automatically for you.
cURL for example, will just take the username and password as parameters, e.g.:

```
curl --user name:password https://api.simwood.com/v3/…
```

PHP's cURL implementation is very similar in that you'd set CURLOPT_USERPWD with [curl_setopt](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.curl-setopt.php).

An example authenticated GET request is:
```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/accounts/{ACCOUNT}/prepay/balance
```

*This example URL will not work directly in a web browser as the {ACCOUNT} placeholder in the above
will need to be replaced with account ID (typically a six digit number)*

Which would return the following

```json
[
  {
    "balance": "12.32",
    "currency": "GBP"
  }
] 
```

Adding `?pretty=true` to the end of the URL would give you the same information in the following format:
```json
[
  {
    "balance": "12.32",
    "currency":"GBP"
  }
]
```

Both are treated equally by a JSON parser, and are syntactically valid, however the ‘pretty-printed' version
may be useful for debugging.

### PUT and DELETE requests
In the spirit of being REST-ful, many URLs can be acted upon with different methods. The URL does not
change, only the HTTP method used against it. One example of this is number configuration, for example:

```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/allocated/{NUMBER}
```

*Again, this will not work as {ACCOUNT} and {NUMBER} need replacing with real data.
{NUMBER} is the e164 representation of the number, e.g. 442031234567.*

`GET` is the default method, accessing the above end-point with a `GET` will return the current configuration of
that number. `PUT` will create the end-point, i.e. allocate the number to your account if it does not exist
already. `DELETE` will remove the end-point, i.e. de-configure and remove the number from your account.
`PUT` is context sensitive and specific uses will be described in greater detail within different commands.
Briefly though, whereas:
```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/allocated/{NUMBER}
```

will create a number end-point, i.e. allocate the number but
```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/allocated/{NUMBER}/config
```

will configure a number, i.e. write the sent config to it.
`DELETE` works more uniformly but only at the level it operates, e.g.

```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/allocated/{NUMBER}
```

will de-configure and remove a number but
```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/allocated/{NUMBER}/config
```
will just remove the configuration, leaving the number on your account

Setting the method is language specific and `PUT` and `DELETE` cannot be easily replicated in a browser. Almost
all environments/browsers will default to GET so the chances are if it doesn't work as you expect you are
using the `GET` method.
For development languages which do not permit all HTTP methods to be used you can pass a hidden
parameter named _method in an HTTP POST or GET and set the method to use in there.
This will override the actual HTTP method used. For example, in an HTTP form you may use:
``<input type="hidden" name="_method" id="_method" value="put" />``


*
 *All modern languages allow HTTP methods to be used correctly, and we would strongly encourage this in preference to setting a _method parameter.*



### POST requests / Reports
`POST` is very similar to `PUT` but is used where one is not updating a specific resource, i.e. requesting reports,
or when creating a new resource
For example, to request a summary of calls and charges for the current day the end-point would be:
```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/accounts/{ACCOUNT}/reports/voice/summary/day/in
```

You would use POST for this request as whilst you are sending a request to the server and the end-point is
fixed, what that end-point represents and what you get back are variable. POST is used for all report type
requests.

The output from such a POST request (which requests a report) will typically be small, i.e.:

```json
{
  "mode": "vsind",
  "date": "2012-01-28",
  "type": "voice_summary",
  "account": "ACCOUNT",
  "format": "json",
  "hash": "4e591630fedf4aa149db9874fb33fe23",
  "link": "\/v3\/files\/ACCOUNT\/4e591630fedf4aa149db9874fb33fe23"
}
```



You will note that this is not in fact a summary of today's charges. It is a hash that uniquely identifies that
report and a link to it. As the return suggests, you can retrieve the actual results with a GET request to

```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/files/{ACCOUNT}/4e591630fedf4aa149db9874fb33fe23
```

#### But don't worry...
Whilst is is important to understand the effect a given request method will have, we are somewhat relaxed in
our interpretation of them where possible. DELETE is always DELETE with no alternative but we will accept a
POST instead of a PUT and a GET instead of a POST where possible. You should not assume we will, and
should adhere to the RESTful way, but this flexibility is there if you wish to test behaviour in a browser for
example.

#### Report De-duplication
As described above, when you request a report the return will just contain a link to the results. That link will
be unique to that specific report, i.e. in the above example the hash for today's summary will be the same with
every request, but only every request `today`. Tomorrow will generate a different hash. If you make multiple
requests for the same report before you retrieve it, duplicates will simply be ignored and the report will only
be run once.

However, once a report has been run, the results await your collection within the next 5 minutes. Further
requests with the same hash will continue to be ignored as long as that report exists. Once the report is
retrieved it will be deleted. Only after a report has been deleted (either by retrieval or expiry), will an identical
report request result in a new report.

`NB` reports expire after 5 minutes, any attempt to access the report after 5 minutes will result in a 404 error,
you should therefore build your application to poll the report URL multiple times as soon as possible after
submitting your request or use the callback URL detailed below.

Hashes are intended to be generated sensibly. For example, a given report for today will always give the same
hash. A different report for today or the same report for tomorrow will give different hashes. Reports on
different numbers will generate different hashes. Further, de-duplication will only apply where previous
results have not been retrieved.

The intention here is to protect the system from the coder who wishes to request a year's CDRs every second.
He can, but all requests other than the first will be ignored until he retrieves the results. This rather extreme
example is actually real and was a consequence of the way the v2 API paginated results and required clients
to step through them. More than a few customer implementations reached the end of the results and went
into a race condition.

#### Report Retrieval
As shown above, the return from a report request will give a hash and an encoded URL. The hash can be used
to access the results directly, even from another system, using a GET request to, for example:
```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/files/{ACCOUNT}/4e591630fedf4aa149db9874fb33fe23
```
This URL can be polled at a sensible interval as it will simply return a 204 No Content until the report exists.
Once the report does exist, it can be downloaded only once and then will be automatically deleted.
To negate the need for polling, clients may instead wish to specify a ‘callback' URL with their request. This
should be POSTed as a variable called ‘callback'. The response to the request will be identical as without it but
on successful generation of the report we will make a POST to the URL provided. This will contain a single
HTTP POST variable call ‘payload' which will contain the report hash in JSON format, e.g.:

```json
{
  "app": "reports",
  "id": "76e7a8102f93c636785ea8432c72e07a", 
  "data": null
}
```

The client should then GET the report as usual within a maximum of 5 minutes, after which it may expire.
#### Dates in Reports
Most reports can be run for a range or at a specific date. Where omitted they will generally default to today.
Dates are always expressed in MySQL format (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss), e.g. 2012-01-01 14:30:00
#### File (Report Output) Handling
Unlike many APIs the Simwood API is asynchronous when requesting some complex reports to improve
performance (this is discussed in more detail above) and some POST requests will result in a small response
containing a hash and ‘link' to a file e.g.
```json
{
  "mode": "vsind",
  "date": "2012-01-28",
  "type": "voice_summary",
  "account": "{ACCOUNT}",
  "format": "json",
  "hash": "4e591630fedf4aa149db9874fb33fe23",
  "link": "/v3/files/{ACCOUNT}/4e591630fedf4aa149db9874fb33fe23"
}
```

The functions below are used to retrieve these:

``
/v3/files/{ACCOUNT}
``

| Method | Description                            |
| :----- | :------------------------------------- |
| GET    | Lists uncollected files on the account |

```json
{
  "ff98d8d8fdf9dfd178e72b6e6ba207ff" {
    "name":"ff98d8d8fdf9dfd178e72b6e6ba207ff",
    "content_type":"application/json",
    "length":410,
    "uri":"/v3/files/ACCOUNT/ff98d8d8fdf9dfd178e72b6e6ba207ff"
  }
}
```

``
/v3/files/{ACCOUNT}/{HASH}
``

| Method | Description                                                                                                                             |
| :----- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | Retrieve specific file on account, where HASH is the hash returned when the report was requested. File will be deleted after retrieval. |



## API Endpoints
If the above has all made sense, you should need little more than a list of the available end-points and the
HTTP methods they support to get going. This follows and you'll quickly observe they are hierarchical and
hopefully consistent. The method shown indicates behaviour as described earlier.

Each endpoint is documented below in the following format:

``/v3/URL``

| Method | Description                                                                                      |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | Explains what happens when the GET method is used                                                |
| POST   | Explains what happens when the POST method is used. Will also explain what parameter is used for |
|        | *parameter*    - An example GET / POST or PUT parameter                                          |
|        | *anotherparam*  -  Another parameter to be sent by POST                                          |

**Please Note** - Where example responses are shown in this documentation they may be reformatted to be
more easily human-readable, the actual response will have escaped slashes (e.g. / replaced with \/) and not
include any excess white space.

| |The following conventions are used in describing the URL or other parameters|
|:--------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|{ACCOUNT}   |      Where a word is capitalised and enclosed by curly braces { } it must be replaced with the appropriate information e.g. {ACCOUNT} or {IP} |
| [ on \| off ] | Where two or more words are separated by the pipe character \| and enclosed within square brackets [ ] these are ‘either or' options. e.g. a url with the form /latest/[1\|5\|10] allows you to specify any of the following 3 URLs:<br/> /latest/1 <br/> /latest/5 <br/> /latest/10 <br/> Arbitrary values (e.g. /latest/15) are not supported |
| URLs | The URLs are shown without the leading https://api.simwood.com/ which must be inserted before the /v3/ when making any API call.  |
| paramname | Parameters are shown in italics, these are passed by GET, POST or PUT in the request and do not form part of the URI (except in the case of the GET request, when they are part of the query string after the ? mark) |
| paramname[] | Parameters with square brackets at the end are different and can be thought of as Array Parameters. These can be passed multiple times but even if only one item is being included you must include the [] on the end. For compatibility with some languages (e.g. PHP with Curl) an integer value can be between the square brackets e.g the following two examples are equivalent: <br/> `?param[]=apple&param[]=orange&param[]=pear` <br/> `?param[0]=apple&param[1]=orange&param[2]=pear` |

#### NB As this is intended to be a human-readable report for debugging purposes the format may change at any time, and without notice, and should not be relied upon.

## Account Management

#### Account Type



Your account will be one of the following four types: `developer, startup, virtual_interconnect, or managed_interconnect`, each have different commercials but are functionally identical. All new accounts start off as ‘Developer', we encourage you to move to ‘Start-Up' for production use, and to consider ‘Virtual Interconnect' or ‘Managed Interconnect' as your requirements evolve.

The differences between these account types can be found in the [Simwood Account Pricing](https://cdn.simwood.com/docs/simwood_account_pricing.pdf) document.

#### Balance Locking

```
/v3/accounts/{ACCOUNT}/prepay/balance/locked
```

We provide the ability to ‘lock' a portion of your balance to make it unavailable to spend. i.e. you can specify the balance at which we'll treat your account as ‘out of credit' and therefore kill calls in progress.

This is normally zero but the balance locking facility enables customers to keep large credit balances without risking the entire amount in the event that they, or a customer, suffer a compromise.

You can set alerts based on the *available* balance (i.e. balance-locked balance) using the balance alert above.

#### Dynamnic Channel Limits

Applies only to accounts without a dedicated channel allocation
Any dynamic channel limits shown in the "dynamic" block take precedence over the usual account limits. e.g. in the above example due to the low balance there is a concurrent channel limit of 3 channels and a rate limit of 30 calls per 10 seconds.

#### Channel Allocation (Inbound/Outbound)
Applies only to accounts with a dedicated channel allocation

For customers with a dedicated self-managed channel allocation, channel_allocation_adjustable is true. You can divide this allocation between inbound and outbound as described below.

#### Channel Allocation (Global Numbers)
Applies only to accounts with global numbers

For customers with global numbering (i.e. non UK or USA), channel_allocation_global_numbers reflects the inbound channel allocation across your Global Numbers

#### Other Limits
These limits are set per-account by Simwood and are based on your traffic.

We impose these limits to protect and manage our network utilisation.

If you require more channels or a higher rate of calls per second please contact team@simwood.com

### Adjusting your Channel Allocation

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/limits
```

Customers with a dedicated channel allocation can manage this allocation, splitting channels between inbound and outbound as required.

**As of version 3.15 this information is now also able to be pushed directly to you via Webhooks, for more information see https://cdn.simwood.com/docs/simwood_webhooks_beta.pdf**

The above example shows many calls in progress to the UK, along with two to Mexico (MX) and one to Spain (ES) - calls are grouped both by destination (keyed by a unique numeric identifier for that destination) in then "calls" group and by country in "countries" - this makes it simple to alert, for example, if there are any more than a predefined number of calls to any country you don't expect.

See **http://blog.simwood.com/2014/01/2-quick-scripts-to-help-you-sleep-easier/** for some examples of how this data can be used to help protect you against fraud and monitor your VoIP traffic.

**This is designed to be used in conjunction with the Webhook HTTP Events (Beta) detailed at https://cdn.simwood.com/docs/simwood_webhooks_beta.pdf**

The {CALL_ID} in the above URL is the call_id element in the JSON objects you receive for call_inbound, call_outbound and inprogress_calls HTTP Webhook events posted to your platform.

As this is a BETA endpoint, the information returned from the above may change at any time, although we will endeavour to ensure backwards compatibility therefore, whilst parameters will be added, it is unlikely that any of the above will be removed.

### Voice CDRs (Inline Response)

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/cdr/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{REFERENCE}
```

Retrieve more information, where available, on a specific call using the reference value returned from the above CDRs (or the CDR Reporting)


**This function is temporarily unavailable as of version v3.10.5 **

**NB date_start and date_end must be within the last 90 calendar days**

### Rejected Calls

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/rejected
```

When calls are rejected by Simwood for any reason (e.g. exceeding a channel limit, invalid CLI information, or because they are on a blacklist or your own do not call list) no CDR is generated and, therefore, they cannot be retrieved with the above endpoints.

These rejections are notified using the notification endpoint you have configured (e.g. by eMail or HTTP post) Additionally, the most recent rejections can be retrieved from the following API endpoints.

**NB** Rejection data should be considered ephemeral. In any event the above endpoints will never return more than data from the current day and the preceding day.

## Voice Trunks

**NB** Trunks were previously located at **/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/outbound** however this endpoint, along with its related sub-resources, are now deprecated in favour of the new, more appropriately named **/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/trunks** resource. The original endpoint(s) will remain in order to preserve backwards compatibility, however they will not benefit from any of the new inbound-specific options.

Trunks should following the naming ACCOUNT-{ID} e.g. if your account is 930004 and the trunk for ACME Products you could name the trunk 930004-ACMEPRODUCTS.
The "L001" trunk is your default **IP-Authenticated** trunk and cannot be renamed, additionally there are some features (Trunk Balances, Realtime Trunk Calls in Progress etc) that are not available on the L001 trunk.


| Method | Description                      |
| :----- | :------------------------------- |
| GET    | List all active outbound trunks. |


```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/trunks/{TRUNK}
```

| Method| Description| 
|:--|:--|
|GET | Request information on specified {TRUNK} |
| PUT | Create new trunk {TRUNK}|
||NB for an ‘auth' trunk the SIP password will be returned ONLY as a response to this API call and cannot be retrieved later. If you forget the password it can be reset as described below (Trunk Password Functions) or (if additional optional configuration parameters specified, see overleaf) Update existing {TRUNK} settings such as channel and rate limits.|
||When creating a new trunk, the **type** can be one of: **IP**  create an IP-authenticated Trunk or **auth** create a username/pass authenticated trunk. for  compatibility, if not specified defaults to 'auth'|
| DELETE | Delete trunk {TRUNK} **NB the default trunk {ACCOUNT}-L001 cannot be deleted** |

Newly created trunks are available for use immediately although, at times, may not show in the outbound trunk list for a short time.

**NB** If you update a trunk and one or more parameters are invalid, the update will succeed with the **valid parameters**, please check the output returned and ensure the trunk is configured as you expect.

Please note that all trunk settings are updated immediately, therefore disabling (e.g. by setting enabled = 0) is an effective way to block any further calls being made on a trunk. It will not stop calls currently in progress.


### Trunk Balances

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/trunks/{TRUNK}/balance
```

Each trunk can have its own balance, this allows you to manage the spend of individual customers. You can also view "inprogress" information for a trunk which will show the value of calls in progress. Where the value of calls in progress exceeds the trunk balance, calls in progress will be ended.

|        | *adjust* Adjust the trunk balance by the amount shown, use negative amounts to decrement the balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| DELETE | Remove the balance from trunk {TRUNK} **NB The trunk will function as before, without it's own balance, so will be limited only by your account balance or balance lock <br />This is NOT EQUIVALENT TO setting a balance to 0 which would prevent further calls being made (i.e. Balance exhausted)** |

**The trunk balance feature is provided for convenience and is not a substitute for your own billing and credit control procedures. Simwood will not be liable for any calls made on a trunk when its trunk-specific balance is depleted for any reason.**


**Examples:**

| **Set balance on trunk 920123-ACME to £200** |
| :------------------------------------------- |
| {"balance": 200}                             |

We strongly recommend that "balance" is used to set an initial balance only, and thereafter the level is maintained using the "adjust" function.

| **Adjust balance on trunk 920123-ACME by £50 (e.g. if Customer has topped up)** |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| {"adjust": 50}                                                                  |

| Adjust balance on trunk 920123-ACME by £20 (e.g. to deduct supplementary services) |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {"adjust": -20}                                                                    |

**NB Your account primary -L001 IP trunk does not support Trunk Balances.**


### Per-Trunk Realtime Call Information

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/trunks/{TRUNK}/inprogress
```

As with your account you can also view realtime "in progress" information on a per-trunk basis.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="request" label="API Request">

  | Method | Description                             |
  | :----- | :-------------------------------------- |
  | GET    | Provides information on the calls currently in progress on the specified TRUNK |

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem  value="result" label="Example Response">

```json

{
  "datetime": "2014-02-30 12:34:35",
  "total": 1.164,
  "callcount": 107,
  "balance": 24.406,
  "percent_available": 0.25,
  "approx_seconds_remaining": 56838,
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Where a trunk has a balance the three additional elements will be present which have the same meaning as in your account snapshot but pertain only to the TRUNK specified:

**balance, percent_available, and approx_seconds_remaining**

These are omitted where a trunk has no balance, but you can still view the current value of calls in progress. 

**NB Your account primary -L001 IP trunk does not support this feature.**

### Trunk IP Functions

The following applies only to trunks using IP-Based authentication, your primary trunk ({ACCOUNT}-L001) is an example of one such trunk which does not require a SIP username and password.

Please ensure you only add IP addresses that you control and DELETE any that are no longer required.

Please note that that this functionality should **NOT** be used to update an account with dynamic IP addresses - such installations, where unavoidable, should use authenticated SIP trunks as described above.

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/trunks/{TRUNK}/acl
```
| Method | Description                                                 |
| :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | Request a list of IP address authorised on ip-based {TRUNK} |

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/trunks/{TRUNK}/acl/{IP}
```

| Method | Description                       |
| :----- | :-------------------------------- |
| PUT    | Add {IP} to ip-based {TRUNK}      |
| DELETE | Remove {IP} from ip-based {TRUNK} |


### Trunk Password Functions
The following applies only to authenticated trunks (those using a username and password) or being used for SIP registration.

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/trunks/{TRUNK}/password_reset
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="request" label="API Request">

| Method | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | Request and return a new password for this trunk.                                                                                                     |
|        | NB The old password will be disabled immediately, any devices configured to use this trunk will need reconfigured to continue to make outbound calls. |


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem  value="result" label="Example Response">

```json

{
    "updated":true,
    "trunk":"{TRUNK}",
    "user":"{TRUNK}",
    "pass":"e5d5aca5e39251bdc19554d3"
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


**NB** It is not possible to specify a password for a trunk, they are automatically generated. 

Likewise, the Operations Desk **cannot** recover a forgotten password, the only facility they have
is to reset the password using the above functionality. Please keep your password(s) safe.

### Outbound Destination Prefix ACLs
Not to be confused with IP ACLs (to determine which IPs can make outbound calls on a particular trunk) Destination Prefix ACLs allow you to limit access on a per-account of per-trunk basis to certain destinations.

The ACL is specified in a JSON-encoded object as follows:

| Variable | Description                                   |
| :------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| *allow*  | Array Allowed Prefixes e.g. [441,442,443,448] |
| *deny*   | Array Denied Prefixes e.g. [44870]            |

This would be encoded in JSON as follows:

```json
{
  "allow":
    [441,442,443,448],
  "deny":
    [44870]
}
```


This example would allow calls to all UK Geographic, 03 Numbers and all 08 Numbers except 0870. 

Please note:
(1) Longest prefix matching is used, so 44870 in the **deny** list will block even if 448 is allowed.
(2) If only **allow** is specified, this is treated as a whitelist. all other destinations will be denied.
(3) If only **deny** is specified, this is treated as a blacklist. all other destinations will be allowed.
(4) Account-level blocks will override any trunk settings.
(e.g. a trunk cannot call a destination blocked at the account level).
(5) Trunk level blocks will override any account-level allows.
(e.g. you may deny certain trunks access to destinations that are otherwise allowed)

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/outbound/destinationacl
```

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/trunks/{TRUNK}/destinationacl
```

| Method | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GET    | Retrieve active ACL on your account or trunk as specified                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| PUT    | Replace active ACL with the JSON object PUT. **The preferred method of doing this is to send the new ACL as the body of the PUT request, however if your implementation does not support this you may send the entire string in a single HTTP form encoded variable ‘payload'** |
| DELETE | Remove the ACL associated with the account or trunk **Please note that the default is to allow access to ALL destinations without restriction - please ensure this is what you want.**                                                                                          |

Calls rejected due to failing a destination ACL rule will have the following X-Reason headers set in the SIP response to the initial INVITE:
      **X-Reason: 447700900123 matches trunk do not route 447**
      **X-Reason: 449098790000 matches customer do not route 449**

Either one of these may have (cached) appended where the number has been blocked more than once in the last 60s, in such case the prefix may not be shown.

**NB** The above ‘destination acl' function is provided on a ‘best-efforts' basis and is not intended as a substitute for securing your own VoIP platform. You remain responsible for all calls made on your account.

### Trunk Routing Configuration
It is now possible to set a trunk-level routing configuration which will be used for any numbers associated with it (and not having their own configuration) - this is ideal for customers who send calls for a group of numbers to one destination, and another group of numbers to a different destination.

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/trunks/{TRUNK}/config
```

| Method | Description                                            |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | Return configuration for {TRUNK}                       |
| PUT    | Replace active configuration with the JSON object PUT. |
| DELETE | Remove configuration for {TRUNK}                       |

For full syntax and available options please refer to [Number Routing Configuration](#number-routing-configuration) below.

### Bulk Number Association
As detailed below, inbound numbers can be associated with a trunk either for billing purposes only, or to make use of its additional controls and/or routing configuration (where one does not exist on the number itself). These associations can be created individually by updating each number as required, or where multiple numbers are to be associated with the same trunk, it can be performed in a single request using the following endpoint.

**NB** If a number has its own specific routing configuration, then any trunk association defined in the ‘options' block will continue to take priority.

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/trunks/{TRUNK}/numbers
```

When associating numbers to a trunk, any individual routing configuration currently set on those numbers will
need to be removed if your intention is for the configuration of the newly associated trunk to be followed. You
can do this for each number individually using the number's own configuration endpoint, or alternatively, if you
wish to remove all number-level configuration at the same time as associating with the trunk, you can include
the optional force property:
```json
 {
 "data": [
 "443301223100",
 "443301223101",
 "443301223102",
 ...
 ],
 "force": true
} 
```

**NB Force removal of configs in this way is irreversible and if done so unintentionally, will need to be added back one by one!**

### IDA Outbound Management
You can access your outbound SIP rates from any* standard BT landline using our shared IDA code **12940**.
Access is restricted to authorised CLIs.

IDA users are managed much like trunks (see above), each number added automatically creates a ‘trunk' in the form {ACCOUNT}-IDA01xxxxxxxxx, you will see these identifiers as the trunk in your CDRs and the same settings can be applied as to trunks (see above)

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/ida
```
| Method | Description                          |
| :----- | :----------------------------------- |
| GET    | Retrieve active IDAs on your account |

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/ida/{CLI}
```

| Method | Description                                                                                                |
| :----- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | Retrieve active IDAs on your account                                                                       |
| PUT    | Create a new IDA user with the specified {CLI} **or (if additional parameters are supplied)**              |
|        | update an existing IDA user (see above "Trunk Management" for an example of what parameters are available) |
| DELETE | Delete the IDA user with the specified {CLI}                                                               |


Users making calls using the IDA service should dial the full number prefixed with 12940 e.g. to call 029 2120 2120 you would dial **1294002921202120**

1. At present you cannot associate more than one CLI with a single IDA ‘trunk'

2. If another Simwood customer has enabled a CLI for the IDA service you will not be able to associate the same CLI with your own account.

*Some landlines may not permit IDA calls*

**IDA for Virtual Interconnect ("Hosted IDA")**
Virtual Interconnect - Inbound customers using their own IDA codes should not use the above functionality. Please contact us for more information on IDA for Virtual Interconnect.

### Number Routing Configuration
Introduced in May 2014, the following is the preferred way of configuring a number, the previous method is still detailed in this document but is deprecated and will be removed in a future revision of the API.

When a new configuration is provided this will take precedence over any existing configuration.

Similarly, it is now possible to set a [trunk-level configuration](#trunk-routing-configuration) which will be used for any numbers associated with it (and not having their own configuration) - this is ideal for customers who send calls to a group of numbers to a single destination, and another group of numbers to a different destination.

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/trunks/{TRUNK}/config
```

| Method | Description                                            |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | Return configuration for {TRUNK}                       |
| PUT    | Replace active configuration with the JSON object PUT. |
| DELETE | Remove configuration for {TRUNK}                       |

Lastly, the default configuration will be used for all numbers on your account where no other configuration exists - this is ideal for customers who send all calls to a SIP URI and handle onward routing themselves

```
/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/trunks/{TRUNK}/config
```

| Method | Description                                                    |

| GET    | Return configuration for {ACCOUNT}                             |
| PUT    | Replace active default configuration with the JSON object PUT. |
| DELETE | Remove default configuration                                   |


#### Number Configuration Syntax - Advanced
**NB** The syntax described in this section applies equally to number, trunk, and default configuration
endpoints.

Numbers are configured using a JSON object which is described below, offering increased flexibility over the previous route configuration.

An example (annotated) configuration is below, and the full list of options can be found overleaf.




```json
"rules": {
  "mon__fri_0700__1700": [
    {
      "dow": [1,2,3,4,5],
      "time": ["0700","1700"]
    }
  ]
},

   ``` 

Rules define times of day that routing blocks (below) apply, outwith the rules given - or if the rules section is omitted entirely - the <b>default</b> routing block will be used.


```json
"routing": {
  "mon__fri_0700__1700": [
    [
      {
        "type": "reg",
        "user": "939998-FREDTEST",
        "timeout": 30,
        "sdes": "optional",
        "opus": "default"
      }
    ],
```

This block will run during the *officehours* time block defined above (Mon-Fri 9am-5pm) 
and will call the SIP endpoint shown and the user on the registration proxy simultaneously.

```json
    [
      {
        "type": "sip",
        "endpoint": "%e164@pbx.mycompany.com",
        "timeout": 30,
        "sdes": "none",
        "opus": "default"
      }
    ],[
      {
        "type": "pstn",
        "number": "447405644486"
      }
    ]
  ],
```
After the timeout above (30s) we will try the PSTN number provided

```json
  "default": [
    [
      {
        "type": "pstn",
        "timeout": 30,
        "number": "447405644486",
        "trunk": "939998-ALAUTHTEST"
      }
    ]
  ]
},
```
The *default* routing block will be used outwith the office hours specified above. 
So calls outside of normal office hours will be forwarded directly to the PSTN number shown.

```json
"options": {
    "enabled": true,
    "block_payphone": false,
    "acr": false,
    "icr": false,
    "beta_in": true
},
```

Per number configuration options (detailed above) apply to the number at all times

```json
{
  "meta": []
}
```
The *meta* block contains arbitrary metadata that you want to associate with the number.


#### Number Configuration Syntax

#### "options"

The following options can be set on a per-number basis, they apply to the entire configuration at all times

|Option|Parameters|Description|Default|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|*enabled*|[true\|false]|Allows number to be disabled [false] without removing the configuration.|Default [true]|
|*block_payphone* | [true\|false] | Prevents inbound calls originating from  payphones |Default [false]|
|*acr*|[true\|false]|Apply ACR to this number. ACR Prevents calls originating from Withheld numbers reaching this number. Withheld callers will be diverted to a recorded announcement.|Default [false]|
|**trunk**|9XXXXX-TRUNK|Associate a trunk with this number for billing purposes ONLY, shown in CDRs.<br/> <br/>**NB** This does NOT result in the number being routed to a registration-based SIP trunk. You would need to use the appropriate ‘reg' routing block.<br /><br/>You can also configure this using the endpoint /v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/allocated/ {NUMBER}/trunk. <br/><br />This option is only relevant for number-level configuration.|Default [9XXXXX-L001] or your account default inbound trunk if different.|


#### **$.. Chargeable Options** 
 Some options may incur additional monthly fees. 
Please see https://simwood.com/rates for full information

#### "rules"

The ‘rules' parameter in the JSON object should be an array of named objects (named using the characters a- z and the _ character only) each of which defines a time period using the following parameters:

|Parameter|Format|Description|
|:--|:--|:--|
|*dow*|Array of values [1..7]|The days of week this rule is active (according to ISO 8601) e.g. **1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday.**<br/> **NB if one day must still be an array. e.g. [3] not 3**|
|*time*|Array [start,end]|Array of two values, denoting the start and end time this rule applies in 24h format (e.g. [0900,1700] would represent 9am - 5pm. The leading 0 can be omitted)|
|day|Array of values [1..31]|The days of month this rule is active **NB if one day must still be an array. e.g. [25] not 25**|
|*month*|Array of values [1..12]|The months this rule is active <br/>e.g. **1 = January, 12 = December. <br/>NB if one day must still be an array. e.g. [3] not 3**|

**Example**


Office Hours - Mon - Fri 0900-1700
```json
{
  "rules":{
    "officehours": [ 
      {
        "dow": [1,2,3,4,5],
        "time": [900,1700]
      } 
    ]
  }
}
```


Weekends - Sat/Sun (All Day)

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "weekend": [
      {
        "dow": [6,7]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Christmas / New Year - Dec 25th , December 26th, January  1st, January 2nd

```json
"rules": {
  "christmasholiday": [
    {
      "month": [12],
      "day": [25,26]
    },{
      "month": [1],
      "day": [1,2]
    }
  ]
}

```


#### "routing"
Much like the rules above the ‘routing' property is an array of objects named corresponding to the rules. There is also the special ‘default' rule, which applies when there are no rules specified or outwith the times specified in the rules.

**NB** This property is mandatory and submitted config will be rejected without it.

Routing blocks (described below) can be arranged to allow dialling in parallel or in sequence, or a
combination of both as shown below:


**Ring A & B simultaneously, Then C**
```json
"routing": {
  "officehours": [
    [
      { BLOCK A },
      { BLOCK B }
    ],[
      { BLOCK C }
    ] 
  ]
}
``` 
**Ring A, B and C simultaneously**
```json
"routing": {
  "officehours": [
    [
      { BLOCK A },
      { BLOCK B },
      { BLOCK C }
    ] 
  ]
}
``` 

**Ring A, then B, then C**
```json
"routing": {
  "officehours": [
    [
      { BLOCK A },
    ],[
      { BLOCK B }
    ],[
      { BLOCK C }
    ]
 ]
}
```


#### "meta"
The ‘meta' parameter in the JSON object allows you to store your own arbitrary data in the Simwood database associated with a number and which can be easily accessed via the API.

The **key** parameter can be used to search for number(s) matching a specified key, the rest of the object is freeform up to a size limit of around 512 bytes.


|key|String[40 chars]|
|:--|:--|
| | A (non-unique) key for this number which you can use to search for matching numbers, most commonly customers use this to store a representation of their own customer account ID or username. <br/>**NB Keys are treated as case-insensitive**|

The rest of the **meta** parameter can be composed of ANY valid JSON structure, some example uses are given below.

#### Examples
<table>
 
  <tr>
    <td>In this example the key is used to store the customer account ID.
The friendlyName is used to allow the customer to assign a memorable name to the number in the customer interface.
The lastUpdated parameter is used to show when a number was last updated.</td>
    <td>

```json
"meta": {
  "key": "403010",
  "friendlyName": "Main office number",
  "lastUpdated": "2014-02-30 01:20:30"
}
```
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In this example the key is used to store the customer eMail address and a password. This could be used to build a simple portal for managing forwarding of one number (e.g. a personal number redirection service)
    <br/><br/>
<b> NB This illustrates a potential use only - please do NOT store clear text passwords in this manner.</b>
</td>
    <td>

```json
"meta": {
  "key": "customer@example.com",
  "pass": "secretWord"
}
```
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>
  This shows how this could be used to store a note associated with a number that hasn't been configured yet.
  </td>
  <td>

```json
"meta": {
  "notes": "This is reserved for Brian at Example Corp",
  "reserved": true 
}
```
  </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The flexibility offered by the "meta" block enables customers to build a full service (e.g. offering number translation services, fax to eMail or similar) without requiring a local database.


**NB** Meta attributes are intended for API use only and are NOT displayed in the portal. These attributes may be overwritten if a number is later configured using the portal.

#### Routing Block
Each routing block is defined by a minimum of a ‘type' and some optional parameters delay and timeout:

|***parameter***|***values***||
|:-|-|:-|
|**type**|sip|SIP endpoint|
||reg |Registered SIP user|
||pstn |PSTN Destination (i.e. voice call forwarding)|
||teams |Send to Microsoft Teams (see [Teams Operator Connect](#teams-operator-connect))|
||fax |Receive as Fax to eMail or HTTP <br/>**NB fax cannot be used in conjunction with any other endpoint**|
||busy |Busy tone|
|delay|[1...n]|Delay before executing this leg|
|timeout|[1...n]|Timeout for answer from this leg Not supported by **busy** or **fax** endpoints|


**NB** A number can be configured for either voice or fax routing
It is not possible to simultaneously use the same number for voice and fax.

#### Routing Block Additional Parameters
Depending on the type of endpoint selected above there are some additional endpoint-specific mandatory and optional parameters:

|type| parameter||
|:-|:-|-|
|**sip**|*endpoint*|SIP Endpoint (user@host.com with optional :port and :transport parameters e.g. %164@example.com:5060:transport=tcp) the following substitutions will take place: <br/>**%e164** will be replaced with the full number in **E164** format <br/>**%ukn** will be replaced with the number in **UK National** format|
||*sdes*|One of **optional, required,** or **none**. If optional we will offer SDES encryption for the audio on inbound calls. If set to required, the call will not complete without successful negotiation of SDES. If not specified, or set to none, SDES will not be offered by default.|
||*opus*|One of **never, always,** or **only**. Override the default handling of Opus offers in INVITEs to your platform: <br /><br/>**never** will suppress the Opus codec from the SDP, which may be useful for UDP destinations to prevent long INVITEs becoming fragmented as Opus does typically increase the SDP payload by around 220 bytes.<br/>**always** will always offer the Opus codec, together with the usual codec offering of G.722 and G.711, in the SDP.<br/>**only** will offer the Opus codec only, excluding all other codecs. This is ideal if your platform uses Opus and you can support Opus for all calls, and still keeps the SDP to a size that is unlikely to result in fragmentation|
||*zone*|One of our zone names [**slo, lon, ny** or **sj**].. <br/><br/>If present, calls originating in the specified zone will be passed to this endpoint, overriding any equal priority endpoints without a zone specified. <br/>This can be used together with multiple sip endpoints to ensure that calls are routed in the most efficient way depending on where they ingress the Simwood network. e.g. calls arriving in London, will route to your own local proxy. <br/>This will be particularly useful to customers with direct connections to Simwood, or hosting their own equipment on- net.<br/><br/>**NB if a call originates from any zone which matches an endpoint with a specific zone set, then any other endpoints within that group will be disregarded.<br/> If the call originates from a zone which does not match a specific endpoint, any endpoint without a zone parameter will be used.<br/>There must always be one endpoint at the same level with no zone specified.**|
|**reg**|*user*|SIP registration user (e.g. 9xxxxx-USERNAME)|
||*sdes*|One of **optional** or **required**. Defaults to **optional**, we will offer SDES encryption for the audio on inbound calls to registered endpoints. If set to required, the call will not complete without successful negotiation of SDES.|
||*opus*|One of **never, always,** or **only**. Override the default handling of Opus offers in INVITEs to your platform: <br /><br/>**never** will suppress the Opus codec from the SDP, which may be useful for UDP destinations to prevent long INVITEs becoming fragmented as Opus does typically increase the SDP payload by around 220 bytes.<br/>**always** will always offer the Opus codec, together with the usual codec offering of G.722 and G.711, in the SDP.<br/>**only** will offer the Opus codec only, excluding all other codecs. This is ideal if your platform uses Opus and you can support Opus for all calls, and still keeps the SDP to a size that is unlikely to result in fragmentation|
|||**NB** if the user is not registered at the time the call is received this will be skipped entirely, we advise you use another destination (or ‘busy') in addition to a **reg** endpoint.|
|**pstn**|*number*|Destination number in e164 format (e.g. 447700900123) <br/>**NB the pstn divert function is intended for voice calls only.**|
||*maxcpm*|Maximum cost per minute (in your billing currency) of the B leg of the call, intended for use with NTS services to limit exposure to expensive destinations or to ensure that the destination number cost is covered by the revenue share from the inbound leg. (e.g. 0.05)|
||*maxcpc*|To be used in conjunction with the above, sets a maximum call cost (e.g. connection cost) <br/>**NB does not limit call duration to a cost ‘limit'**|
||*cli*|CLI to present when forwarding the call, if not specified will present the callers CLI where it is available.|
||trunk|The trunk to be associated (for billing and CDR purposes) with the outbound (B-leg) (e.g. 9xxxxx-TRUNKNAME)|
|**teams**|no parameters available|The tenant ID is not required since calls will be routed automatically based on the target number|
|**fax**|*method*|One of **http** or **mail**|
||*endpoint*|Destination eMail address or HTTP POST URI e.g. user@host.com http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi/inboundfax.php|
|**busy**|no parameters available|


**NB** The ‘pstn' endpoint is intended for **voice calls only**.
We cannot guarantee successful transmission of fax or data calls forwarded to the PSTN using this functionality.

#### Number Configuration Worked Examples

<table>
<tr>
 <th>Call user@host.com over SIP for 20s, then try 447700900123 with custom CLI</th>
 </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>

```json

{
  "routing": {
    "default": [
      [
        {
          "type": "sip",
          "endpoint": "user@host.com",
          "timeout": 20
        }
      ],[
        {
          "type": "pstn",
          "number": "447700900123",
          "cli": "442921202120",
          "maxcpm": 0.02
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

 </td>
  </tr>
  </table>




<table>
<tr>
 <th>Forward all calls to 447700900123</th>
 </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>

```json

{
  "routing": {
    "default": [
      [
        {
          "type": "pstn",
          "number": "447700900123"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

 </td>
  </tr>
  </table>


  <table>
<tr>
 <th>Forward all calls to SIP endpoint</th>
 </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>

```json

{
  "routing": {
    "default": [
      [
        {
          "type": "sip",
          "endpoint": "%did@sip.mycompany.com"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

 </td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  The above might seem complicated but corresponds to the following simple PHP example, which illustrates the underlying structure:

<table>
<tr>
 <th>PHP Example of above</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
<td>

```bash

<?php
// Define the route
$arrayRouteDefinition = Array('type' => 'sip', 'endpoint' => ‘%did@sip.mycompany.com'):
// Add it to the ‘default' routing block
$arrayRouting['default'][] = Array($arrayRouteDefinition):
// Add the routing configuration to the config
$arrayConfig['routing'] = $arrayRouting:
// encodedConfig now contains the JSON encoded routing
$encodedConfig = json_encode($arrayConfig):
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Another advantage of this method is that you can retrieve the configuration as a JSON object via your favourite programming language, edit the required entry in place and PUT the changed configuration back.

#### Number Configuration - Success
Changes should take effect immediately, and the following simple JSON object will be returned:

||||
|:-|:-|-|
|success | true |Will always be true when the routing has been successfully updated.|

#### Number Configuration - Errors
In the event of a configuration error a simple JSON object will be returned as follows:

||||
|:-|:-|-|
|success |false |Will always be **false** where any error was present.<br/>Your config will **NOT have been changed.**|
|errors |Array |This will contain an array of human-readable errors each will include an indication of where the error was in your structure. A non-exhaustive list of these are below. |


**NB Where any error is present in the configuration the extant configuration will remain in place even if only one element has an error, the entire configuration will be rejected.**|


| | |  
|:--|:-|
|Setting **‘OPTION'** must be **X, Y or Z**|An option in the "options" section has an invalid value, please select from one of the provided values |
|Invalid parameter **‘OPTION'** in settings |A parameter in the "options" section is unrecognised. please remove this parameter|
|Rule name **‘NAME'** is invalid.|Rule names must contain the characters shown only|
|[Rule|Routing Block] must be an array.|Rules and routing blocks must be arrays, even if they contain only one item.|
|Rule **‘NAME'** entry **X** parameter **‘PARAM'** is invalid.|The value provided for the parameter in the rule shown is invalid.|
|Routing block **'NAME'** does not match any specified rules (or default) | A routing block has been specified that doesn't correspond to any time-dependant rules (or "default") - therefore would never be called. Check your rule names match.|
|Unknown section **‘NAME'** in configuration.|There is a section that is unrecognised, if you wish to store your own information in a number configuration you may do so but this must be within the ‘meta' section (which can contain anything)|


### Inbound Trunk Association

Inbound numbers can be associated with a trunk either for billing reconciliation purposes only, or to take advantage of some of the trunk-specific controls and/or routing configuration for inbound traffic. If a number- level configuration exists then this will take priority over any trunk-level configuration, which in turn, will take priority over the default account-level configuration.

**NB** This does NOT result in the number being routed to a registration-based SIP trunk. You would need to use the appropriate ‘reg' routing block in either the Number or Trunk Configuration as shown above.

`/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/allocated/{NUMBER}/trunk`


<table>

  <tr>
  <td>
  <b>GET</b>
  </td>
  <td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
<td>
<b>DELETE</b>
</td>
<td>Remove the association with the trunk</td>
</tr>
  </table>

### Mobile Number Inbound SMS Configuration

**NB** Only mobile or OTT numbers can be configured for inbound SMS.

UK Mobile Numbers will be able to receive SMS (this includes both OTT numbers and MSISDNs obtained from Simwood, as well as SMS to numbers ported-in) - you can deliver these over HTTP to your own platform.

`/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/allocated/{NUMBER}/sms`

<table>

  <tr>
  <td>
  <b>GET</b>
  </td>
  <td>

Request current inbound SMS configuration for the provided number

```json

{

#### Number Configuration - 999 Emergency Services
`/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/allocated/{NUMBER}/999`

|Method|Description|||
|:-|-|-|-|
|**GET**|Return current 999 information for {NUMBER}|||
|**PUT**|Replace current 999 details on {NUMBER} <br/>Please note maximum field lengths indicated below|||
||*title*|20|**Individual End User Only**<br/>Title (e.g. Mr, Ms, Mrs)<br/>Titles that disclose gender are preferred by the Emergency Services.|
||*forename*|20|**Individual End User Only**<br/>Forename or Initials|
||*name*|50|**Mandatory for Individual and Business End Users**<br/>Individual End User - Surname<br/>Business End User - Business Name [See Note 1]|
||*bussuffix*|50|**Business End User Only**<br/>Suffix (Ltd, Plc) [See Note 2]|
||*premises*|60|**Mandatory for Individual and Business End Users**<br/>Identifies premises on a thoroughfare i.e. House Number or Name (e.g. 104, The Lighthouse, Thatched Cottage)|
||*thoroughfare*|55|**Mandatory for Individual and Business End Users**<br/>Street Name (e.g. King Street, Station Road, Beech Avenue)|
||*locality*|30|**Mandatory for Individual and Business End Users**<br/>Village or an area within an Town and Town if possible|
||*postcode*|12|**Mandatory for Individual and Business End Users**<br/>The full current postcode as recognised by Royal Mail’s PAF database. This must be in the form Out-code space In-code e.g. LS11 5DF, S9 5AD, S60 3ML|


**Remember this information is to assist the Emergency Service response and you have a legal obligation to ensure this information is provided fully and accurately to the best of your ability.**

The name and address information should be sufficient to identify the premises or individual promptly in an emergency. This is more important than it matching the ‘official' record: for a business entry include only the business details, do NOT specify your contact there or primary account holder etc as an individual.

**Note 1 : Business Names**
Business names should be chosen that best allow the Emergency Services to identify and locate the business - typically this is the ‘name over the door' rather than that of a parent or holding company irrespective of who you address the bill to.

**Note 2 - Business Suffix**
Addition to business name (e.g. Ltd or Plc) this can also be used to include a brief description that identifies the function of the business - e.g. "Hospital", "Hotel", "Fuel Storage Depot" provides valuable extra information to the Emergency Services


**$ Submission Charge** 
There is a charge for this service.
Please see https://simwood.com/rates for full information


### Number Validation
We provide a simple API endpoint to allow you to determine if a particular number is in a valid format and is suitable for use as valid Caller ID.

This endpoint also provides other useful information about the number, such as the original Carrier (if known), Country, Type of Number, and information from the local authority (e.g. Ofcom) where possible.

`/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/validate/{NUMBER}`

<table>
<tr>
<td>GET</td>
<td>

Validate the <b>number</b> provided (number should be in e.164 format) ( e.g. the following result would 
be obtained from a <b>GET</b> request to <b>/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/validate/443301223000</b> )

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "valid": true,
    "country_code": "44",
    "iso": "gb",
    "national_number": "3301229999",
    "type": "uan",
    "carrier": "Simwood",
    "timezones": [
      "Europe\/Guernsey",
      "Europe\/Isle_of_Man",
      "Europe\/Jersey",
      "Europe\/London"
    ],
    "formatted": {
      "e164": "+443301229999",
      "national": "0330 122 9999",
      "international": "+44 330 122 9999"
    },
    "ofcom": {
      "status": "allocated",
      "use": "national non-geographic",
      "rh": "Simwood eSMS Limited",
      "date": "2010-07-20",
      "valid_cli": true
    }
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>


For UK numbers, the ofcom->valid_cli parameter can be used to determine if this number would be accepted as valid Caller ID in the UK in accordance with Ofcom policy and General Condition C6. This takes into account numbers (such as 09) which are valid numbers, but cannot be used as Caller ID.

**NB** This is not a "live" lookup like an HLR lookup or look-ahead routing lookup, the indication that a number is 'valid' here solely confirms it appears to formatted correctly and does not indicate if the number is in service. Furthermore, the carrier, where present, will reflect the original carrier of the number if a number has been ported to a new operator.


### Number Lookup
We provide a simple API endpoint to allow you to look up the rangeholder information for a particular number or number range.

<br/>This may be of use to customers looking to port numbers, however it should be noted that if a number has previously been ported the LCP may not be the rangeholder

<table>
<tr>
<td>GET</td>
<td>

Lookup information on the <b>number</b> provided (number should in e.164 format) ( e.g.
 the following result would be obtained from a <b>GET</b> request to <b>/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/lookup/443301223000</b> )

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "formatted": "+44(0)330 1223000",
  "data": {
    "code": "3301",
    "prefix": "330122",
    "rh": "Simwood eSMS Limited"
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>


## Number Porting
Ports can be submitted, and viewed via the API.

There are different endpoints (and data required) depending on the type of port, it is imperative you use the correct endpoint for the type of port requested.

|type of number|port type||
|:-|-|-|
|UK Geographic Numbers<br/>**01xxxxxxxxx <br />02xxxxxxxxx**|GNP|Geographic Number Porting is outlined in our Geographic Number Portability Guide.<br />Numbers can be ported from most major fixed-line and VoIP service providers and lead times are subject to the type of port.<br />You must have authority from the end user to port a number, and evidence of this may be requested.|
|UK Mobile Numbers<br/>**07[1-9]xxxxxxxxx**|MNP| Mobile Number Portability is managed differently from GNP.<br/>Numbers can be ported from all UK MNOs and MVNOs and the port will typically take 2-3 days. The active mobile service (and SIM) associated with the number will cease when the port completes.<br />MNP requires a "PAC" (Porting Authorisation Code) to authenticate the porting request. This is provided to the existing subscriber by their Mobile Service Provider. This code must be provided at the time of porting.<br />PACs are valid for 30 days.|
|UK Non-Geographic Numbers<br/>**03xxxxxxxxxx <br/>08[457]xxxxxxx**||At present, these numbers cannot be ported via the API.<br/> Some NGNs are portable, please contact the Porting Desk.|
|UK Premium Rate Numbers<br/>**070xxxxxxxx <br/>09xxxxxxxxx**||At present, these numbers cannot be ported|


#### Update December 2016
Please note that there are now two endpoints listed for each GNP API function as follows

`/v3/porting/{ACCOUNT}/ports`

`/v3/porting/{ACCOUNT}/gnp`

We strongly recommend use of the /gnp endpoint for consistency with the new porting types, however the /ports endpoint provided historically will remain in service for backward compatibility.

#### Port Types
Each port will be one of the following types, if unsure please contact the LCP before submission. Subsequent ports must be used where the number is already ported (i.e. the LCP is not the rangeholder) Please observe the lead times in the Number Portability Guide when specifying a port_date.

<table>
<tr>
<td><b>single</b></td>
<td>Single Line - 4 Working Days (14 if > 10 lines porting in same installation/time)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>multi</b></td>
<td>Multi Line - 7-17 Working Days (dependant on number of lines/numbers, see guide)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>sub_single</b></td>
<td>Single Line - 7 Working Days (17 if > 10 lines porting in same installation/time)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>sub_multi</b></td>
<td>Multi Line - 10-25 Working Days (dependant on number of lines/numbers, see guide)</td>
</tr>
</table>

The above is provided for guidance only, the Number Portability Guide should be consulted to determine lead times for porting requests.

#### Number Object
The ‘numbers' array in the above should be an array of objects each with the following structure. These must include all numbers, including the MBN (even though it is specified separately)

|Parameter|Values||

```


**Response**
The response will be a JSON similar to the following:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "ref": 12345,
  "url": "/v3/porting/{ACCOUNT}/ports/12345"
}
```

The *"ref"* value corresponds to the ticket that will be used to track the progress of the porting request.
If any error(s) occurred whilst validating the configuration these will be returned as follows:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": [ "Message #1", "Message #2" ]
}
```

#### Port Resubmissions
When resubmitting a previously rejected port, please use the original porting order number in the **orig_ref**
parameter to ensure your port is processed and billed correctly at the reduced rate for resubmissions.

**NB** Failure to provide this will result in the port being processed as a new order and the normal porting fees applicable to the order type will apply.

#### View Porting LCPs
To be used when submitting new porting requests, this endpoint provides a list of available LCPs and the corresponding CUPIDs.

This endpoint provides a list of all CPs with which we have established non-geographic porting agreements. It is worth noting, however, that there may be other rangeholders we can port from where their range is hosted by one of the CPs in this list.

`/v3/porting/{ACCOUNT}/lcps`

<table>
<tr><td>GET</td>
<td>
Get list of LCP (Losing Communications Providers) we can port from and the corresponding CUPIDs
<tr>

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "cps": [
    {

      "cupid": "1"
    },{

      "cupid": "93"
    },{
      "cpName": "Gamma Telecom",
      "cupid": "31"
    }
  ]
}

```
</tr>
</td>
</tr>
</table>


**NB** When providing a CUPID in the API you can use either an integer (e.g. 1) or conventional format of the three digit string value (e.g. 001 for BT)

**When submitting a porting request where a number is hosted by a different network, please provide the CUPID of the hosting network (e.g. an ITSP using Telephony Services for number hosting should have the lcp_cupid provided as "093")**

## HTTP POST (Inbound Events)
Certain commands enable us to send data to your system over HTTP(S) in response to events rather than commands. These events are:

- Fax received on a number configured for HTTP POST 
- SMS received on a number configured for HTTP POST 
- The status of outgoing SMS messages
- The progress of outgoing faxes

In all cases the message will be sent to the URL you specified and will intelligently retry until a HTTP response with a status code of 200 and a non-zero length body is returned in response, which indicates success.

Your application must therefore raise an error code in the HTTP header (e.g. 500) in the event of a problem rather than a plain text message in the body of the response. All responses are discarded.

### Event-driven Webhooks
There are now a number of event-driven webhooks available which provide realtime information on calls in progress, incoming and outgoing calls, along with call rejections and other account-wide events.


#### Outbound Webhooks
You can configure your Simwood account to enable you to receive messages to your own HTTP
endpoints for certain events (e.g. a new call, a call ending, or messages received) 

**BETA NOTICE**

The functionality outlined in this document should be considered "BETA" and is provided as-is and
without warranty and should not be relied on for any production commercial service. This beta test
invites you to test new functionality before it is made generally available and your feedback during
this time is very much valued. The specification of this API is subject to change without notice
although we will endeavour to ensure any changes are backwards compatible.

**REQUESTS**

Only https URLs are supported for WebHooks.
TLSv1.0 minimum is required and TLSv1.2 is recommended.
All requests are made in **JSON** format with a Content-Type of text/json to a pre-configured URL.
Each JSON message follows a standard 'wrapper' format with a number of consistent parameters;

<table>
<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th><th>Type</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>app</td>
<td>Application Name</td><td>String</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>id</td>
<td>Identifier for this message
This is unique per message, where multiple events are sent for a
single object (e.g. a call) there will be an id within the data block also.</td><td>String</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>timestamp</td>
<td>Timestamp for this message (ISO 8601 in UTC)</td>
<td>String</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>data</td>
<td>Array of JSON objects containing request data</td>
<td>Array</td>

</tr>
</table>
The application name is provided to facilitate serving multiple functions from a single endpoint, 
however we strongly recommend individual URLs for each type of WebHook. 


#### Configuring Events / WebHooks
Some events on the Simwood platform (for example a new call, blocked call, an answered call, low 
balance warning etc) can generate a notification to your own platform using standard HTTP 
"WebHooks" that are called when an event is triggered. These can be configured in the portal. 

Each individual application type ("app") can be configured to a different URL, or you can configure a 
default URL for all WebHook requests. Each request includes an "app" parameter to allow one URL 
endpoint to be used for multiple event types if desired, although we would generally recommend 
discrete URLs for this purpose. 

#### Authenticating Requests

A future update will introduce an X-Simwood-Authenticate header, containing a signature that can 
be used to verify the authenticity of the message.


#### Authenticating Source

All WebHook HTTP requests will originate from the following source networks. These should be 
allowed through your firewall on port 443 (unless a non-standard port is used for your service) 
- 178.22.139.84/31 
- 185.63.140.84/31 
- 185.63.142.84/31 
- 185.63.141.84/31 
- 185.63.143.84/31 

#### Call Events

##### Inbound Calls

An inbound call to a number on your account can generate a number of call_inbound events at 
various stages of the call (e.g. ringing, answered, hangup). 

<table>
<tr><th>Call_inbound</th><th></th><th></th></tr>
<tr>

<td></td>
<td>New inbound call, or updated status on an existing inbound call.</td><td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>app</td>
<td>call_inbound</td><td>String</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>id</td>
<td>Unique ID for this event message</td><td>String</td>
</tr>



<tr>
<td>timestamp</td>
<td>The timestamp for this event </td>
<td>String</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>data</td>
<table>
<td>Array of JSON objects containing request data</td>
<td></td>
<td>Object</td>


<tr>

<td>call_id</td><td>ID for this call</td><td>String</td>
</tr>


<tr>

<td>trunk </td><td>The trunk associated with the number</td><td> String </td> </tr>


<tr>
<td>from</td><td> Caller ID in e164 format</td><td> String</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>to</td><td> Destination number in e164 format</td><td> String</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>origin</td><td> Origin type (e.g. 'mobile', 'fixed', 'payphone')</td><td> String</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>route</td><td> The route used for the call</td><td> String</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>reason </td><td>  If failed, the reason for the failure (where available) </td><td>String</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>q850 </td><td>The Q.850 Cause Code (where available)</td><td>Integer</td></tr>

</table>
</tr>


</table>

**Example**
```json
{ 
 "app": "call_inbound", 
 "id": "483e9bdf-b82f-4778-a83e-4722d7f45279", 
 "timestamp": "2019-07-03 14:56:24", 
 "data": { 
 "call_id": "538c2815-4ca2-4e86-ad5a-c55ce267983e" 
 "status": "ringing", 
 "trunk": "930000-ACME", 
 "from": "443301223000", 
 "to": "447700900123", 
 } 
}
```

**Please note that the format of IDs can change, and should not be relied upon to be consistent at 
this time. You should ensure that this is always treated as a string even if purely numeric.**


##### Advanced Call Routing 
**The inbound call functionality works best with a single endpoint.** Where multiple endpoints (e.g. for 
call hunting) are specified you may receive multiple messages (e.g. ringing / bus / rejected) for each 
destination leg. An upcoming update will address this and provide more information for individual legs. 

##### Outbound Calls 
An outbound call on account can generate a number of **call_outbound** events at various stages of the 
call (e.g. ringing, answered, hangup), together with a **cdr** event on completion of the call, or a short 
time afterwards, when the call is rated. 

<table>
<tr><th>Call_outbound</th><th></th><th></th></tr>

<tr>

}
```

*Please note that the format of IDs can change, and should not be relied upon to be consistent at 
this time. You should ensure that this is always treated as a string even if purely numeric. *


##### Blocked Calls 

Where a call is blocked (e.g. due to an account limit, trunk limit, or fraud prevention setting) an event 
is triggered as detailed below. This could be used to warn your customer, or to help inform your own 
monitoring. 

<table>
<tr><th>call_blocked</th><th></th><th></th></tr>



<tr>
<td>app</td>
<td>call_blocked</td><td>String</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>id</td>
<td>Unique ID for this event message</td><td>String</td>
</tr>

<td></td>
<td>Object</td>

<tr>

<td>direction</td><td>The direction of the call, one of **in** or **out**</td><td>String</td>
</tr>


<tr>

<td>trunk</td><td> The trunk associated with the call</td><td> String </td> </tr>

<tr>

<tr>
<td>reason </td><td>  Human readable reason this call was blocked. 
This is also returned in the X-Reason header on the 
rejection. </td><td>String</td></tr>

</table>
</tr>


</table>

**Example**
```json
{ 
 "app": "call_blocked", 
 "id": "483e9bdf-b82f-4778-a83e-4722d7f45279", 
 "timestamp": "2019-07-03 14:56:24", 
 "data": {

 "trunk": "930000-ACME", 
 "from": "443301229999", 
 "to": "447700900123", 
 "reason": "Trunk rate limit of 2 calls per 30s exceeded" 
 } 
}
```

**Please note that the format of IDs can change, and should not be relied upon to be consistent at 
this time. You should ensure that this is always treated as a string even if purely numeric. **

##### Warning of Calls with Invalid Signalling 
Where a call has invalid signalling (e.g. an invalid destination number, or invalid CLI) an event is 
triggered as detailed below. These events indicate calls that would be blocked when these are strictly 
enforced or, for some account types, calls that may incur a surcharge. 
These can be used to identify calls that may fail, and improve the quality of traffic you send. 

<table>
<tr><th>call_warning</th><th></th><th></th></tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Call that generated a warning due to invalid signalling</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>app</td>
<td>call_warning</td><td>String</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>id</td>
<td>Unique ID for this event message</td><td>String</td>
</tr>



<tr>
<td>timestamp</td>
<td>The timestamp for this event </td>
<td>String</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>data</td>

<table>

<td>An object containing the following parameters:</td>

<td>Object</td>


<tr>
<td>direction</td><td>The direction of the call, only **out** at present</td><td>String</td>
</tr>


<tr>

<td>trunk</td><td> The trunk associated with the call</td><td> String </td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>tag</td><td> The content of the X-Simwood-Tag header if present</td><td> String</td></tr>


<tr>
<td>from</td><td> Caller ID in e164 format</td><td> String</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>to</td><td> Destination number in e164 format</td><td> String</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>reason </td><td> Human readable description of the problem with the 
call (e.g. Invalid CLI, or Invalid Destination). 
This is also returned in the X-Warning header in the 
response to the INVITE </td><td>String</td></tr>

</table>
</tr>

</table>

Example
```json
 { 
 "app": "call_warning", 
 "id": "0c72e5a2-40d2-4ab3-90dc-c9a2234c63b3", 
 "timestamp": "2020-04-06 12:15:38",

 "from": "447700900123", 
 "to": "443301229999", 
 "reason": "Invalid CLI" 
 } 
}
```

**Please note that the format of IDs can change, and should not be relied upon to be consistent at 
this time. You should ensure that this is always treated as a string even if purely numeric.** 

##### Calls In Progress Summary 
A summary of the calls in progress (identical in structure to that provided by the API endpoint at 
**https://api.simwood.com/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/inprogress/current** is available, this is sent 
periodically (the time interval is variable) and can be used to produce a live summary of the activity on 
your Simwood account, much like that shown on the Simwood Portal.

##### Call Control 
The **call_id** provided in the above events can be used to inspect or end a call via the Simwood API, for 
example to end a call in progress send a DELETE request to the following API endpoint; 
For more information see the full Simwood API Documentation at 

https://api.simwood.com/v3/voice/{ACCOUNT}/inprogress/{CALL_ID}

**DELETE**  End an in-progress call.

```json
Response { 
 "success": true 
}
```

##### CDR 
On completion of a call, or a short time afterwards, a CDR event is generated.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE** 

**CDRs from the beta WebHooks service are not, at this time, suitable as the sole means of billing.**

Whilst we endeavour to ensure pushed CDRs are accurate and complete there is the possibility, 
during the beta period, that this service will not be available 100% of the time. In the event of any 
period of unavailability, CDRs generated during this time will not be retransmitted. 
We therefore encourage all customers to use the API to download CDRs, at least on a daily basis, 
and reconcile against their own records. 


#### Messsaging Events
At this time, you can configure inbound SMS and Fax individually on a per-number basis, these 
features will be exposed via the standardised WebHook service in a future update. 


#### Account Management Events

##### Updated Ratecard 
Your Simwood rate card will change from time to time, we can send a notification of this to your 
platform to facilitate automatic buy rate updates ensuring you always have the most up-to-date rates 
for destinations over Simwood. 

**rate_update**

<table>
<tr><td></td><td>New rate cards available </td><td></td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>app</td>
<td>rate_update</td><td>String</td>

 "url": "..." 
 } 
}
```

##### Trunk and Configuration Events 

When a new trunk is added or removed from your Simwood account, or a configuration change is 
made, an event is generated. In a future update WebHooks will be provided for these to allow you to 
create an audit trail of these actions, or respond to unexpected changes. 

This will replace the current HTTP notifications for these events. 


#### Compliance Events

##### EHA Data Notice 
Where a call is made to the Emergency Services (999) without valid address data these are reported to 
us by the EHA, and we ask that you endeavour to obtain the relevant information from your customer 
and update the number using the API. This WebHook allows you to automate this process. 

**eha_missing_data**

<table>
<tr><td></td><td>Report of a 999 call made without valid address data </td><td></td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>app</td>
<td>eha_missing_data</td><td>String</td>
</tr>

<tr>

#### Number Portability Events

##### Porting Status Update 
Currently for UK GNP and NGNP only, events are generated when the status of a pending port 
changes, these coincide with updates to the ticket. 


**Porting**

<table>
<tr><td></td><td>Change of status of an outstanding GNP or NGNP porting request </td><td></td> </tr>

<tr>
<td>app</td>
<td>porting</td><td>String</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>id</td>

 "data": { 
 "orderid": 72763, 
 "status": "submitted_lcp", 
 "comments": "Approved by Simwood, Submitted to LCP" 
 } 
}
```

The sequence of events you receive will differ depending on the type of port (for example a subsequent 
port will have a submission to the LCP and Rangeholder separately)

### Outbound SMS Delivery Reports (DLRs)
Where a report field was specified for an outgoing SMS, we will make a POST to the URL specified. If present, ‘%id%' in your URL will be replaced by the message ID returned in the response below and ‘%status%' will be replaced with the status code.

Additionally the POSTed data will contain a single parameter called payload, the value of which will be a JSON encoded representation of the following.

<table>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>app</td>
<td>‘sms_send_status' in this case. This is to facilitate re-use of the same status receiver your side for multiple applications.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>id</td>
<td>The unique id for the SMS returned when it was submitted.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>status</td>
<td>
A numeric indication of status. There will typically be three for SMS.
<br/><br/><b>1 Received: </b>This will be raised immediately the SMS is committed to a queue at Simwood. Generally this will be simultaneous with your message submission but messages will be queued between the API and Simwood systems for performance.
<br/><br/><b>2 Submitted:</b> The SMS has left Simwood. Again, this will generally coincide with your submission and status 1 above but queueing at every stage affords scalability and performance enhancement.
<br/><br/><b>11 Delivered:</b> Confirmation received from the handset of delivery. Generally this will be 4 seconds or so after the above for a handset in signal.
<br/><br/><b>12 Rejected: </b>Message was rejected, has not been delivered and will not be retried.
<br/><br/><b>13 Error: </b>There was a syntax error with the message, usually relating to invalid destination address but in some cases disallowed source address.
<br/><br/><b>14 Queued:</b> Message has been buffered for delivery in transit. This usually indicates the phone is off or out of service coverage.
<br/><br/><b>18 SMSCa: </b>Message has been accepted by the SMSC. For networks where delivery reports are unavailable, this is the closest status to a delivery receipt.
<br/><br/><b>26 SMSCr: </b>Message was rejected by the SMSC and will not be retried.
