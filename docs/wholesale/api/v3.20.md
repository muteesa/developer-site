## Overview

### What is it?

The Simwood Customer API ("Application Programming Interface") is a way for your own back-office systems
and web sites to seamlessly integrate with Simwood and manage your wholesale telephony account and
services.

### What can I do with it?

The API is the preferred way to configure your Simwood services. Everything in the portal can also be
configured via the API (and in some cases the API offers some additional functionality)
Our portal is based on the API, and everything you can do in the portal you can do through the API in your own
code. We’ve deliberately made it this way. The only exception to this is the authentication elements of the
portal, as using your API key to log in on the web would be cumbersome.

### Architecture

Some of our customers follow how we do things with interest - this page is for them.
If you don’t care, you can safely skip it.
The best way to keep up to date with the latest developments behind the scenes is via our blog;
http://blog.simwood.com/
### Web
The v3 API, like its predecessors, is predominantly written in PHP served by nginx. nginx takes care of basic
HTTPS functions but all header generation is done in code. This way the API can be RESTful in its responses.
There is no state maintained in the web-app.
### Databases
As before, many queries are made against MySQL although we have dedicated servers for the API’s use.
These are built for queries and are slaves of masters. We can build additional query servers sideways as
required. Writes are, of course, made against the masters. Increasingly, API requests are served directly from
our underlying REDIS ram-based data stores where possible.
### Middle-ware
This API introduces multiple layers in between the above for performance and scale:
#### Beanstalkd Queues
We use Beanstalkd a lot for internal messaging. In this API where a request is non-trivial and involves
other processes, we’ll simply queue a job.
#### REDIS
REDIS replaced memcached as our caching data store, and is used for much more as it supports a
number of advanced data structures facilitating vastly improved monitoring and real-time
information.
See http://blog.simwood.com/2013/06/real-time-big-data/ for more information.
#### App Servers
We have numerous daemons running monitoring specific queues (pipes in beanstalkd language). One
of the beautiful features of beanstalkd is that it is blocking, i.e. 10 daemons can watch the same pipe
and code will block waiting for a response.
One, and one only, will be given the job when there is one. This avoids polling – meaning this is
extremely efficient and very scalable as we can just spin up as many daemons as required. Further,
release of a job to a daemon is sub-millisecond giving the queueing the performance of direct
requests. Most complicated jobs involve multiple daemons working through a sequence of queues.

## Basic Operations
The Simwood API can be found at the following URI;
https://api.simwood.com/v3/
PLEASE NOTE THAT TLS v1.1 OR HIGHER IS MANDATORY FOR ALL REQUESTS
### Basic GET Requests

A number of end-points in the API can be accessed with a simple GET request and will therefore work in a
browser. Some do not require authentication and are a good place to start and to test connectivity to the API.

Two simple examples are:

https://api.simwood.com/v3/tools/myip - will return your IP address as seen by the API
https://api.simwood.com/v3/tools/time - will return a timestamp from the API

### JSON Output Format
You’ll see that in both above cases the output is JSON, e.g:


``
{"timestamp":1388748052,"rfc":"Fri, 03 Jan 2014 11:20:52 +0000"}
``

JSON (“JavaScript Object Notation”) is used as it’s a lightweight format designed for exchange of data
structures which has an additional advantage of being relatively human readable. All modern languages such
as PHP, ASP, .net, Node, Perl etc can handle JSON structures and convert to/from their native objects or
arrays easily making it the ideal choice for REST APIs.
### “Pretty” JSON
JSON is designed to be machine-readable and as such is sent with minimal whitespace by default however
when developing it is often useful to see the output in a more human-friendly format, you can achieve this
simply by appending `“?pretty=true”` to any endpoint e.g https://api.simwood.com/v3/tools/time?pretty=true
would look like this;

``` 
{
  "timestamp": 1388748052,
  "rfc": "Fri 03 Jan 2014 11:20:52 +0000"
}
```

### Authenticating Requests
Most commands are linked to an account and therefore require authentication.
We use standard Basic Authentication, i.e. your client makes a request, we respond with a 401 response code,
your client replies with the API username and password included.
Your API username and password were provided at the time of creating your Simwood account, if you do not
have these please contact our support team and we’ll be happy to provide you with them.

Note that, at present;

- Your API username and password is not the same as your portal login details
- Your API password is designed to be used programatically, and is typically not memorable
- Your API details allow full access to your account, and must be protected accordingly.
- You cannot, currently, change your API username or password - although our support team are happy to
do so if required (e.g. if your details are lost or you have reason to believe they are compromised)

If you pull up an example URL in your browser it’ll do this for you. For your code, different development
languages will tackle this in different ways but most will ‘just deal with it’ automatically for you.
cURL for example, will just take the username and password as parameters, e.g.:

``curl --user name:password https://api.simwood.com/v3/…``

PHP’s cURL implementation is very similar in that you’d set CURLOPT_USERPWD with [curl_setopt](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.curl-setopt.php).

An example authenticated GET request is:
```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/accounts/{ACCOUNT}/prepay/balance
```

*This example URL will not work directly in a web browser as the {ACCOUNT} placeholder in the above
will need to be replaced with account ID (typically a six digit number)*

Which would return the following

``[{"balance":"12.32","currency":"GBP"}] ``

Adding `?pretty=true` to the end of the URL would give you the same information in the following format;
```
[
  {
      "balance": "12.32",
      "currency":"GBP"
  }
]
```

Both are treated equally by a JSON parser, and are syntactically valid, however the ‘pretty-printed’ version
may be useful for debugging.

### PUT and DELETE requests
In the spirit of being REST-ful, many URLs can be acted upon with different methods. The URL does not
change, only the HTTP method used against it. One example of this is number configuration, for example;
```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/allocated/{NUMBER}
```

*Again, this will not work as {ACCOUNT} and {NUMBER} need replacing with real data.
{NUMBER} is the e164 representation of the number, e.g. 442031234567.*

`GET` is the default method, accessing the above end-point with a `GET` will return the current configuration of
that number. `PUT` will create the end-point, i.e. allocate the number to your account if it does not exist
already. `DELETE` will remove the end-point, i.e. de-configure and remove the number from your account.
`PUT` is context sensitive and specific uses will be described in greater detail within different commands.
Briefly though, whereas:
```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/allocated/{NUMBER}
```

will create a number end-point, i.e. allocate the number but
```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/allocated/{NUMBER}/config
```

will configure a number, i.e. write the sent config to it.
`DELETE` works more uniformly but only at the level it operates, e.g.

```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/allocated/{NUMBER}
```

will de-configure and remove a number but
```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/numbers/{ACCOUNT}/allocated/{NUMBER}/config
```
will just remove the configuration, leaving the number on your account

Setting the method is language specific and `PUT` and `DELETE` cannot be easily replicated in a browser. Almost
all environments/browsers will default to GET so the chances are if it doesn’t work as you expect you are
using the `GET` method.
For development languages which do not permit all HTTP methods to be used you can pass a hidden
parameter named _method in an HTTP POST or GET and set the method to use in there.
This will override the actual HTTP method used. For example, in an HTTP form you may use:
``<input type="hidden" name="_method" id="_method" value="put" />``


*
 *All modern languages allow HTTP methods to be used correctly, and we would strongly encourage this in preference to setting a _method parameter.*



### POST requests / Reports
`POST` is very similar to `PUT` but is used where one is not updating a specific resource, i.e. requesting reports,
or when creating a new resource
For example, to request a summary of calls and charges for the current day the end-point would be:
```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/accounts/{ACCOUNT}/reports/voice/summary/day/in
```

You would use POST for this request as whilst you are sending a request to the server and the end-point is
fixed, what that end-point represents and what you get back are variable. POST is used for all report type
requests.
The output from such a POST request (which requests a report) will typically be small, i.e.:

```
{"mode":"vsind","date":"2012-01-28","type":"voice_summary","account":"ACCOUNT","format"
:"json","hash":"4e591630fedf4aa149db9874fb33fe23","link":"\/v3\/files\/ACCOUNT\/
4e591630fedf4aa149db9874fb33fe23"}
```



You will note that this is not in fact a summary of today’s charges. It is a hash that uniquely identifies that
report and a link to it. As the return suggests, you can retrieve the actual results with a GET request to
```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/files/{ACCOUNT}/4e591630fedf4aa149db9874fb33fe23.
```
#### But don’t worry...
Whilst is is important to understand the effect a given request method will have, we are somewhat relaxed in
our interpretation of them where possible. DELETE is always DELETE with no alternative but we will accept a
POST instead of a PUT and a GET instead of a POST where possible. You should not assume we will, and
should adhere to the RESTful way, but this flexibility is there if you wish to test behaviour in a browser for
example.

#### Report De-duplication
As described above, when you request a report the return will just contain a link to the results. That link will
be unique to that specific report, i.e. in the above example the hash for today’s summary will be the same with
every request, but only every request `today`. Tomorrow will generate a different hash. If you make multiple
requests for the same report before you retrieve it, duplicates will simply be ignored and the report will only
be run once.

However, once a report has been run, the results await your collection within the next 5 minutes. Further
requests with the same hash will continue to be ignored as long as that report exists. Once the report is
retrieved it will be deleted. Only after a report has been deleted (either by retrieval or expiry), will an identical
report request result in a new report.

`NB` reports expire after 5 minutes, any attempt to access the report after 5 minutes will result in a 404 error,
you should therefore build your application to poll the report URL multiple times as soon as possible after
submitting your request or use the callback URL detailed below.

Hashes are intended to be generated sensibly. For example, a given report for today will always give the same
hash. A different report for today or the same report for tomorrow will give different hashes. Reports on
different numbers will generate different hashes. Further, de-duplication will only apply where previous
results have not been retrieved.

The intention here is to protect the system from the coder who wishes to request a year’s CDRs every second.
He can, but all requests other than the first will be ignored until he retrieves the results. This rather extreme
example is actually real and was a consequence of the way the v2 API paginated results and required clients
to step through them. More than a few customer implementations reached the end of the results and went
into a race condition.

#### Report Retrieval
As shown above, the return from a report request will give a hash and an encoded URL. The hash can be used
to access the results directly, even from another system, using a GET request to, for example:
```
https://api.simwood.com/v3/files/{ACCOUNT}/4e591630fedf4aa149db9874fb33fe23
```
This URL can be polled at a sensible interval as it will simply return a 204 No Content until the report exists.
Once the report does exist, it can be downloaded only once and then will be automatically deleted.
To negate the need for polling, clients may instead wish to specify a ‘callback’ URL with their request. This
should be POSTed as a variable called ‘callback’. The response to the request will be identical as without it but
on successful generation of the report we will make a POST to the URL provided. This will contain a single
HTTP POST variable call ‘payload’ which will contain the report hash in JSON format, e.g.:

```
{"app":"reports","id":"76e7a8102f93c636785ea8432c72e07a","data":null}
```

The client should then GET the report as usual within a maximum of 5 minutes, after which it may expire.
#### Dates in Reports
Most reports can be run for a range or at a specific date. Where omitted they will generally default to today.
Dates are always expressed in MySQL format (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss), e.g. 2012-01-01 14:30:00
#### File (Report Output) Handling
Unlike many APIs the Simwood API is asynchronous when requesting some complex reports to improve
performance (this is discussed in more detail above) and some POST requests will result in a small response
containing a hash and ‘link’ to a file e.g.
```
{
  "mode":"vsind",
  "date":"2012-01-28",
  "type":"voice_summary",
  "account":"{ACCOUNT}",
  "format":"json",
  "hash":"4e591630fedf4aa149db9874fb33fe23",
  "link":"/v3/files/{ACCOUNT}/4e591630fedf4aa149db9874fb33fe23"
}
```

The functions below are used to retrieve these;

``
/v3/files/{ACCOUNT}
``

|GET|Lists uncollected files on the account                                            |
|:--|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

```
{
"ff98d8d8fdf9dfd178e72b6e6ba207ff" {
"name":"ff98d8d8fdf9dfd178e72b6e6ba207ff",
"content_type":"application/json",
"length":410,
"uri":"/v3/files/ACCOUNT/ff98d8d8fdf9dfd178e72b6e6ba207ff"
}
}
```

``
/v3/files/{ACCOUNT}/{HASH}
``

|GET |Retrieve specific file on account, where HASH is the hash returned when the report was requested. File will be deleted after retrieval.            |
|:--|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


### API Endpoints
If the above has all made sense, you should need little more than a list of the available end-points and the
HTTP methods they support to get going. This follows and you’ll quickly observe they are hierarchical and
hopefully consistent. The method shown indicates behaviour as described earlier.

Each endpoint is documented below in the following format;

`/v3/URL`

|GET |Explains what happens when the GET method is used                                                             |
|:----|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|POST |Explains what happens when the POST method is used. Will also explain what parameter is used for
|     |*parameter*    - An example GET / POST or PUT parameter                                             |
|     |*anotherparam*  -  Another parameter to be sent by POST                                            |

`Please Note ` - Where example responses are shown in this documentation they may be reformatted to be
more easily human-readable, the actual response will have escaped slashes (e.g. / replaced with \/) and not
include any excess white space.

| |The following conventions are used in describing the URL or other parameters|
|:--------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|{ACCOUNT}   |      Where a word is capitalised and enclosed by curly braces { } it must be replaced with the appropriate information e.g. {ACCOUNT} or {IP} |
| [ on \| off ] | Where two or more words are separated by the pipe character \| and enclosed within square brackets [ ] these are ‘either or’ options. e.g. a url with the form /latest/[1\|5\|10] allows you to specify any of the following 3 URLs;<br/> /latest/1 <br/> /latest/5 <br/> /latest/10 <br/> Arbitrary values (e.g. /latest/15) are not supported |
| URLs | The URLs are shown without the leading https://api.simwood.com/ which must be inserted before the /v3/ when making any API call.  |
| paramname | Parameters are shown in italics, these are passed by GET, POST or PUT in the request and do not form part of the URI (except in the case of the GET request, when they are part of the query string after the ? mark) |
| paramname[] | Parameters with square brackets at the end are different and can be thought of as Array Parameters. These can be passed multiple times but even if only one item is being included you must include the [] on the end. For compatibility with some languages (e.g. PHP with Curl) an integer value can be between the square brackets e.g the following two examples are equivalent; <br/> `?param[]=apple&param[]=orange&param[]=pear` <br/> `?param[0]=apple&param[1]=orange&param[2]=pear` |
